Note: This code has been adjusted to newer (5.x) versions of Minetest
      by me (Sokomine). These changes where necessary because the old
      version of 3dforniture would crash newer games.

Changes:
      * moved the mod up one level in the file system hierarchy for
        easier installation
      * removed HTML crafting guide (no longer necessary)
      * removed changes to papyrus and trees (such things ought to be done in
        a seperate mod if desired)
      * adjusted code so that it no longer crashes in new versions:
        right-click toilet and table lamp in order to use them (also
        more consisent with recent changes)
      * tiny code optimizations
      * nodes that cannot be crafted (open toilet, lamps in diffrent
        stages) no longer appear in the creative inventory
